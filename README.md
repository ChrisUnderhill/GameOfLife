# GameOfLife

Game can be run by compiling the code and running GUILife. I have used patterns
provided by the Cambridge Computer Laboratory. The software allows gifs to be
exported but beware, these can get very large very quickly. Board states are
cached so if a pattern is slow loading you can allow it to "buffer" first 
before going back to watch it at a faster rate.
